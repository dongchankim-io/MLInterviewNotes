\section{Data \& Features}

\subsection*{Q: What is a feature and what is a channel in the context of machine learning and deep learning?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{feature} generally refers to an individual, measurable property or characteristic extracted from raw data. Features serve as input signals that help a machine learning model learn patterns and make predictions or decisions.

	\item A \textbf{channel}, in the context of deep learning—particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—refers to the depth dimension of the input or output tensor. It corresponds to the number of filters or feature maps learned by a convolutional layer. For example, an RGB image has three channels (red, green, blue), and a CNN may produce dozens or hundreds of channels after processing.
\end{itemize}
